                K-15 was a Macedonian comedy show project established in the mid-1990s in Macedonia. It is mostly made
                up of episodes of short comedy sketches and spoofs on the Macedonian language. K-15 as a term is used
                for other projects with the group, such as the comical music of Duo Trio, different kinds of commercials
                or guest appearances in other shows and films such as Balkankan.

                K-15 was formed by Vasko Todorov, Ljupƒço "Bubo" Karov and Branko Ognjanovski, with frequent appearances
                of other actors/comedians. The three founders are also co-directors and co-producers.

            <h2 class="content-title">History</h2>

            <p>
                The three characters decided to create a unique job opportunity for themselves - a weekly comedy show,
                not only providing them with a salary, but also entertaining and making laugh all those who live, know
                of, or have experience with the social and cultural situation in Macedonia. The first episode was
                broadcast on November 23, 1994 on A1 TV.

                Since then, the show has provided strong social, political, and economic criticism of various peculiar
                events in the Macedonian society, ethnic tolerance, stereotypes, taboo-topics and the environment. K-15
                aired on many TV channels such as MTV 1, Sitel, A1, Alfa TV and K-15 TV. In 2008 the group decided to
                form their own independent channel known as K-15 TV. The channel airs predominately Macedonian music
                with occasional K-15 sketches and commercials. K-15 TV is available on the satellite network too. They
                also have their own YouTube channel with more than 900 videos.

            <h2 class="content-title">Impact on society</h2>
            <p>
                While the show had ended in 2013, the Macedonian comedy trio has helped pave the very narrow path of
                open-mindedness and embodiment of the concepts of freedom of thought, expression and opinion, while
                shattering a half century old tradition of self-righteousness, faux-perfectionism, and pretentiousness
                that stem from the one party social order of communism in the former Yugoslavia

                The fan base of K-15 is extremely wide in Macedonia. This is mainly fitting with the content of the
                jokes and skits of the show; problems and issues everyone can see first hand in their own community.
                Additionally, the show has also received a very large following outside of Macedonia as well, especially
                in the Macedonian diaspora in the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-title">History of Macedonian comedy</h2>

            <p>
                Macedonian comedy has a history rooted in ancient Greek comedic traditions. It flourished after gaining
                independence from the Ottoman Empire, with theater and later film and television becoming popular
                platforms.
                Satire and political humor have played a significant role, and contemporary comedy includes stand-up and
                online content. Some Macedonian comedians have gained international recognition, showcasing the
                country's
                comedic talent on a global stage.
