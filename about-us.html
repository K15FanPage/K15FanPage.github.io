                <span>Our story</span>
            </h2>
            The story of our K-15 fan page began with a shared love for the show that bound us together as friends
            and fans. Realizing that there was a gap in the online K-15 community, we decided to channel our passion
            into something creative. And thus, our fan page was born.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 id="about-us-subtitle">
                <span id="right-slide">The birth of this page</span>
            </h2>
            Pooling our talents, we worked diligently during our free hours to create a fan page that could serve as
            a central hub for all K-15 enthusiasts.
            We're students, friends that made this project with the will to learn Web Development and have fun. This
            project is dedicated to our favourite (no longer existing) TV comedy show called "K-15". We thought this
            website will get viewed since the K-15 show is no longer emmiting on television and this site is kind of
            a tribute to it and a fan page in one.

                <span>Our mission</span>
            </h2>
            Our mission is simple: to create a haven for K-15 enthusiasts like us. We believe in celebrating the
            magic of K-15, and our fan page is our labor of love dedicated to this remarkable show. We aim to be
            your go-to source for K-15 content, discussions, and community engagement.
            <br>

            <h2 id="about-us-subtitle">
                <span id="right-slide">Why K-15?</span>
            </h2>
            K-15 has touched our hearts in a way that few other shows have. Its captivating characters, intricate plot
            twists, and thought-provoking themes have left an indelible mark on us. We understand the depth of emotion
            and excitement that K-15 fans feel, and we're here to share in that experience with you.
            <br>

            Thank you for the visit and for the support.
