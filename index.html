                K-15 was a Macedonian comedy show project established in the mid-1990s in Macedonia. It is mostly made
                up of episodes of short comedy sketches and spoofs on the Macedonian language. K-15 as a term is used
                for other projects with the group, such as the comical music of Duo Trio, different kinds of commercials
                or guest appearances in other shows and films such as Balkankan.

                K-15 was formed by Vasko Todorov, Ljupƒço "Bubo" Karov and Branko Ognjanovski, with frequent appearances
                of other actors/comedians. The three founders are also co-directors and co-producers.

                The three characters decided to create a unique job opportunity for themselves - a weekly comedy show,
                not only providing them with a salary, but also entertaining and making laugh all those who live, know
                of, or have experience with the social and cultural situation in Macedonia. The first episode was
                broadcast on November 23, 1994 on A1 TV.

                Since then, the show has provided strong social, political, and economic criticism of various peculiar
                events in the Macedonian society, ethnic tolerance, stereotypes, taboo-topics and the environment. K-15
                aired on many TV channels such as MTV 1, Sitel, A1, Alfa TV and K-15 TV. In 2008 the group decided to
                form their own independent channel known as K-15 TV. The channel airs predominately Macedonian music
                with occasional K-15 sketches and commercials. K-15 TV is available on the satellite network too. They
                also have their own YouTube channel with more than 900 videos.
